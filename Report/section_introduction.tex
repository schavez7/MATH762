\section{Introduction}
The goal of this project is provide an example of shear wave propagation through hyperelastic materials using finite element methods. The equations are interest look like
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\partial v}{\partial t} + \nabla\cdot P = 0,
\end{equation}
where $v$ is the velocity and $P$ is the first Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor (PK1).
