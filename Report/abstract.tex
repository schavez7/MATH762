The goal of this project is to provide an example of shear wave propagation through homogenous, isothermal, isotropic, hyperelastic materials using finite element methods. This project is divided up into two milestones. The first milestone aims to construct a plane wave equation solver using Deal.II. The second milestone simply expands from the first milestone to the goal of this project. Unfortunately, only part of milestone two was created. The final product is a two-dimensional linear elastic simulation.
