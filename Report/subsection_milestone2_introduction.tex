The ultimate goal of this project is to produce wave propagation through a hyperelastic material which can be given by the following hyperbolic equation
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq::Elastic_wave}
  \frac{\pd^2 \bm{u}}{\pd t^2} - \nabla\cdot \bsig = \bm{b}.
\end{equation}

By solving two wave equations at the same time, the code can then be adjusted nicely to incorporate problem with vector valued solutions such as the elastic problem above. In addition, the Runge-Kutta has been modified to allow for non-linear problems by changing the formulation in (\ref{eq::Numerical_ODE}) to
\begin{eqnarray}
  \label{eq::Numerical_ODE_New}
  \frac{\pd \bm{U}}{\pd t} & = & \bm{V}, \nonumber \\
  \frac{\pd \bm{V}}{\pd t} & = & -\bm{M}^{-1}\bm{h}(\bm{U}) + \bm{M}^{-1}\bm{F},
\end{eqnarray}
where $\bm{h}$ takes care of the non-linear components. Using this formulation the Runge-Kutta needs to be solved at each stage of the method (i.e. solve for each $\bm{k}_i$).
