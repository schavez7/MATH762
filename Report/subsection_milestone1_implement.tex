\subsection{Implementation}
To ensure that the method and code works an example is created based on the method of manufactured solution. Let the test solution be
\begin{equation}
  u(x,y,t) = \sin(x)\sin(y)\sin(t).
\end{equation}
under the domain $[0,2\pi]\times[0,2\pi]$. Therefore, through the method of manufactured solutions the problem with initial conditions and boundary conditions is given by
\begin{eqnarray*}
  \frac{\dd^2u}{\dd t^2} - \Delta u & = & \sin(x)\sin(y)\sin(t), \\
  u(x,y,0) & = & 0, \\
  \frac{\pd u}{\pd t}(x,y,0) & = & \sin(x)\sin(y), \\
  u(x,t)\bigg|_{\pd\Omega} & = & 0.
\end{eqnarray*}

The code demonstrates this implementation.
